# Rubik-Cube-Simulator

Program has a lot of space for improvement.

For example, I wanted to have a net of the cube in the corner or something. I also wanted to implement a timer, and a leaderboard as well.
This may well be something that I come back to in the future, so that I could polish it up and add all of the features I initially wanted to.

75-80% of the work was the report itself - the way you were assessed was how well you did your report really. You could have a really mediocre program, but if your report was top-notch you could easily get 65/70... So a large focus was on the report rather than on the functionality of the program.

Also I procastinated alot so that wasn't good - but I got a good learning experience on why you don't procastinate.

Overall, I got 66/70 for the NEA.
