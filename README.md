# Rubik-Cube-Simulator

Program could deffo be improved. I wanted to have a net of the cube in the corner or something
Furthermore, I also wanted to implement a timer, and a leaderboard as well.
This may well be something that I come back to in the future, so that i could polish it up
and add all of the features I initially wanted to.
Though in any case, I remember speedrunning all of this in the span of a few days... that was fun (no it wasnt).
75-80% of the work was the report itself - the way you were assessed was how well you did your report really.
You could have a really mediocre program, but if your report was top-notch you could easily get 65/70... So, I spent too much time probably on the report.
Also I loved procastinating so that wasn't good - good learning experience though on why you don't procastinate.
I had 8 months-ish to complete the report I think, but i procastinated for 7 probably.
